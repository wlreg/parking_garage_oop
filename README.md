### Cost of parking garage is $5.00/hour. With free parking for stays under a hour, and the garage stops charging after you're parked for 8 hours or longer.


#### ticket tracking portion of code definitely wouldn't hold up in real-life scenario, basically is a 'first in-first out' logic, wouldn't take into account vehicles with different length stays but i thought from what instructions asked this would be ok.
